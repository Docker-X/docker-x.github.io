# DevSecOps 

It is a **"Shift Left Approach"** practice with DevOps to maintain the security at multiple layers of the application development pipeline. 

## Security Operations 

There are three components of the the security 

1. Vulnerability 
2. Exploit
3. Threat

When we  are thinking about the security for the system, it is important to think about the above three components for **Risk** Analysis. 

### Weaknesses in the Web Applications:

- The first list is created by **OWASP(Open Web Application Security Project)**, called **OWASP Top10**. These are the most commonly exploited vulnerabilities. 
- Second list is **CWE(Common Weakness Enumeration)**


## Resouces
